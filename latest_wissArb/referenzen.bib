abstract = {This paper discusses issues of importance to designers of media for visually impaired users. The paper considers the influence of human factors on the effectiveness of presentation as well as the strengths and weaknesses of tactile, vibrotactile, haptic, and multimodal methods of rendering maps, graphs, and models. The authors, all of whom are visually impaired researchers in this domain, present findings from their own work and work of many others who have contributed to the current understanding of how to prepare and render images for both hard-copy and technology-mediated presentation of Braille and tangible graphics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1998 Heldermann Verlag. An important question in educational research is whether the imparting of knowledge and skills also improves pupils' intelligence. This aspect of transfer of learning is difficult to study within the framework of educational research. The longitudinal study presented here shows, based on sophisticated test materials and methods of analysis, that courses in Descriptive Geometry improve pupils' spatial ability, a primary dimension of intelligence. Also, sex differences that were clearly present at the first testing disappeared during "training" in Descriptive Geometry.},

abstract = {Human-computer Interaction in three dimensions is not well understood, and there are few 3D applications in common use. Moreover, the complications of 3D interaction are magnified in immersive virtual environment (VE) applications: characteristics such as inaccurate tracking and lack of access to traditional input devices cause the design of user interfaces (UIs) and interaction techniques (ITs) for immersive VEs to be extremely difficult. Despite these difficulties, we maintain that there are complex applications for which immersive VEs are desirable, so special attention needs to be paid to the design and implementation of ITs for these applications. A large percentage of interactions that take place in immersive VEs fall into a small number of general categories, which include travel (movement of the user's viewpoint from place to place), selection (indicating virtual objects within the environment), and manipulation (setting the position and/or orientation of virtual objects). Given techniques with good performance characteristics for these three interactions, a large number of complex and effective VE applications could be built. In this research we studied ITs for these three universal tasks in the context of a formal, systematic framework, including the design of novel ITs and empirical, comparative evaluations of techniques. This thesis presents several important results of the use of this methodology. First, we have developed new ITs perform well in a variety of application scenarios. Second, we have designed general testbeds for IT evaluation that may be reused for future performance comparisons. Third, we have obtained a large set of empirical results regarding the performance of ITs. These results led to general principles and guidelines (section 7.1) that can be applied to VE systems to improve performance. Finally, we validated these results by applying them to a real-world VE application, and showing that its usability was measurably improved as a direct result. The results presented in this thesis should be useful and important to anyone developing a VE system with even a moderate amount of interaction complexity.},

It is based on the mobile collaborative augmented reality system "Studierstube". We describe our efforts in developing a system for the improvement of spatial abilities and maximization of transfer of learning. In order to support various teacher-student interaction scenarios we implemented flexible methods for context and user dependent rendering of parts of the construction. Together with hybrid hardware setups they allow the use of Construct3D in today's classrooms and provide a testbed for future evaluations. Means of application and integration in mathematics and geometry education at high school as well as university level are being discussed. Anecdotal evidence supports our claim that Construct3D is easy to learn, encourages experimentation with geometric constructions and improves spatial skills. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Educators face major challenges as a result of the shift from the Information Age to the Experience Age (Wadhera, 2016). For example, students are passive and disengaged (Capps and Crawford, 2013) and may struggle to see the relevance of what they are learning to their lives (Gee, 2009); also, important skills needed for 21st century learners – such as empathy, systems thinking, creativity, computational literacy, and abstract reasoning – are difficult to teach (Smith and Hu, 2013). Virtual reality, an immersive, hands-on tool for learning, can play a unique role in addressing these educational challenges. In this paper, we present examples of how the affordances of virtual reality lead to new opportunities that support learners. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations and next steps.},
